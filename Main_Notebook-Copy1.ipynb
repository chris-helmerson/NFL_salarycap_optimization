    "# NFL Salary Cap Optimizer by Position\n",
    "\n",
    "Background: In an effort to broaden its audience, the NFL is expanding its roster from 32 teams to 34 teams with two new franchises to be located in London, UK and Vancouver, CA. We have been approached by the ownership group from one of the cities and they are eager to establish themselves as serious contenders to maximize public interest and in turn, revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem: The ownership group has asked us how their team can best maximize win percentage during the regular season (17 games)  by looking at how to best allocate their available \"Salary Cap\" (league imposed spending limit on players).\n",
    "\n",
    "Goals: Use historic nfl data to predict a team's regular season win percentage given how much they spend on diffent player position groups and provide recomendations on how they should best spend their salary cap.\n",
    "\n",
    "Methodology: Scrape historic nfl player contract data and team win percentage data from the internet. "
